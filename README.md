# Shareboard

A shared whiteboard app.

Right now, the application is entirely local. Only one user can draw black lines with a fixed stroke width. But slowly, I hope to add multi-user LAN connectivity, colors, save to SVG, and other features.

Tested on MacOS and Chrome. Not tested on Windows, Linux, iOS, Android.
